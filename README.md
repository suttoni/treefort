# treefort

Abstract:
  A simple website that allows users to send and receive messages, create posts, etc created primarily with Python with the use of Flask, some HTML, some CSS.


Description:
  Treefort is an attempt to create a different spin on the "Post" and "Message" centric genre of Social Networks. Treefort's main focus is that of allowing users to post short questions on a certain educational topic (for simplicity sake, we're starting off with questions concerning the Python language).

Answer feature:
  To answer a question, the user will have to think fast. There will be a time limit, a few minutes, that is aimed to try to get the question answered as quickly as possible.

Quality Control - Point System:
  The points in our system, referred to as "Leaves", will be used in a few major ways; quality control, reputation, and followers.
  
  To prevent bad answers to a question, an upvote system will be implemented. If a question is very poor quality, it can be downvoted by the community. This is to discourage trolling.

  The more leaves a users Treefort has, the greater his/her reputation. In turn, they can use their leaves to gain followers. A user can message another user and offer an amount of leaves in exchange for their "follow".
